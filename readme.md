## Lumen PHP Framework

To build the PNWPHP website, we have chosen [Lumen](http://lumen.laravel.com/docs).  Laravel Lumen
is a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant
syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling.
Lumen attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of
web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, queueing, and caching.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Lumen website](http://lumen.laravel.com/docs).
